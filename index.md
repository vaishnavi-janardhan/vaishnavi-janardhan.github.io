## The First Encounter

As a neophyte to programming, I didn't know where and what to start with. Android development seemed intimaidating to me. Neither did I know Java nor did I have any prior experience in programming. That's when I learned about [Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/) from a friend and I started my first ever online course. It was a beginners course on Java. I am so glad that I took the **Leap of Faith**!

## The Turning Point

While I was going through the other courses on Udacity, I came across the **Google-Udacity Android Beginners Scholarship Programme**. With no second thought I applied for it hoping to get selected (though I was aware of the tough competition I would face!).
On the 7th of February 2018 I find an e-mail from the Udacity Scholarships Team mentioning that I was selected for the scholarship. My happiness knew no bounds. The scholarship badge was and still remains an asset to flaunt.

## The Road Ahead

Equipped with the well curated courses of Udacity, Mentors who have the answers to all my queries and an enthusiastic batch of peers who keep me motivated day in and day out, the road seems planned but there is no Final Destination(though there are plenty of Landmarks on the way).

# Thank You UDACITY !!!
